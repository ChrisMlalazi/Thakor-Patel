        <p>Thakor Patel was born in India in 1932. He grew up in Sojitra, Gujarat, and studied art in Ahmedabad and Bombay. While he was working as a textile artist in Meerut, a relative invited him to visit Zimbabwe. He arrived shortly after independence in 1980, and has lived in Harare ever since.

        Patel says of his own work that he would be able to take one particular theme and pursue it for a lifetime. He chooses not to do that. His work is sometimes about form and structure using simple, solid geometric shapes, sometimes about his response to African artefacts, and sometimes animated recreations of life forms.

        His work is in private collections throughout the world, and he has held many well-reviewed solo exhibitions in Zimbabwe, London and the USA.
